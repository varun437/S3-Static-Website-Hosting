# Configuring a s3 static website using a custom domain registered with Route 53<a name="website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough"></a>


## Step 1: Register a custom domain with Route 53<a name="website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough-domain-registry"></a>

If you don't already have a registered domain name, such as `example.com`, register one with Route 53\. For more information, see [Registering a New Domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-register.html) in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*\. After you register your domain name, you can create and configure your Amazon S3 buckets for website hosting\.
